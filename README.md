Cornwall is a different way of using Appcelerator's Titanium. It
uses a webview centric design while exposing the full native
Titanium API.

Any `cornwall://` links from your browser will be
launched in Cornwall to give you the ability to execute native code
from the web.

Inspiration is really from [here](http://venturebeat.com/2012/05/02/linkedin-ipad-app-engineering/)

It is still very new. Not ready for Android, so treat this as a sneak
peak.

Getting Started
---------------

NOTE: a better README should be on its way.

Look at the `index.html` in the `Resources` directory to see how to use
Cornwall in an app.

If you want to see how to use Cornwall in a webpage look at the example
in the `example` directory. Fire up the static webserver enter `node
server.js` then go to `http://localhost:8888` in Safari from your
iphone.


Limitations
-----------
Many. It is still new.


Project Name
------------

[It is where Titanium is/was
found](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium). Do do anything useful you
need to get to where Titanium is found.
